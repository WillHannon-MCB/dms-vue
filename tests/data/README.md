# Example Datasets

This directory contains example datasets that highlight the various use cases of `dms-vue`. Here the examples I plan to add:

- `multiple_conditions.csv`: data with more than one condition.
- `discontinuous_chains.csv`: data split over different chains in a model
- `multiple_models.csv`: data mapping to more than one structure
- `categorical_data.csv`: data that isn't numerical (i.e. annotations)
